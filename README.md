# A Pacman Remake game made with Unity

### Current Unity Version: 2019.4.12f

- A faithful pacman remake made in one week for a game jam.
- This is a sample of my work as a gameplay programmer and does not reflect my current skills, I made it in late 2019.

## Controls:
- Arrow Keys / WASD -> Movement and Menu Selection
- Return / Space bar -> Select Action
- Esc -> Cancel Action

## Features:
- Two different boards: Classic Pacman / Ms Pacman.
- Ghosts behaviors implemented like the originals made back in 1980. (https://gameinternals.com/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior)
- Bonus items -> The fruits that appear mid level while playing
- Local Multiplayer -> Each player plays one at a time. Player with the biggest score wins.
